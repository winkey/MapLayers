tilecache:

    add a bg job that rms the tiles when a layer is deleted
    add a second config table and layers for 4326 for view in google earth


layers:
    change layer pkeys to bigint
    move choices inside the class
    only return tree items you have perms to view
    real forms for adding data
    the help text needs populated for everything
    add perms to the tree

    make the layer tree view take an arg of a id to return return its children 


mapfile:
    color picker
    editor to draw symbols
    real forms for adding data
    the array stuff works but the form is a text field
    allow nulls
    the help text needs populated for everything
    map/config should be a table or array or something
    map dont seem to have layer id
    many of the sub tables can have multiple there is only one now


map:

    add a print mechanism
    the help text needs populated for everything
    the time slider toolbar should display the current datetime 
    refresh the client when the layer tree changes, perhaps signals again in the map app
    do the admin so you can do intial settings


        
    test kmlrepeater

javascript:
    only download the tree parts that are open<---- this is in the next parts
    as folders are opened they should request a tree for that folder from the view and be added to the tree
    a link should request its target right away
    a animation should request its target right away
    js: how do we update the tree when the data is updated?

    need rightclick menues in the layer tree to add delete etc..

    time slider should update the url hash, bookmarks should include the time
    make the view in google earth button do timestamps/timezones
    all the time settings should be in the url has as long as there is data in the list

    make draw on screen actualy save data as new layers or features in a layer
    add move to  to the time slider so you can folow a event around the world over time

    TogglePane + BC could easily do that probably (I say TogglePane because it has code for handling the collapsing IIRC

    split timeslider

bookmark app:

    we could call them views, and 
    bookmarks are all the url hash vars stored in a seperate table


owslib app:
    [14:14:20] <winkey> https://pypi.python.org/pypi/OWSLib
    [14:14:53] <winkey> i think a add all layers on wms feature would be neat
    [14:15:11] <winkey>  Author: Tom Kralidis
    [14:16:16] <winkey> or a window that lists them as checkboxes
    [14:16:57] <winkey> mayby a thing that adds them as a siggle or as a seperate

    or something like the wms inspector for js on the client side?

vector app:
    some sort of vector data aplication
    upload data mech


raster app:
    raster data in db?



greyline app:
    this could just be a client side thing, its a circle

mapnik support?
