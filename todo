tilecache:

    add a bg job that rms the tiles when a layer is deleted
    add a second config table and layers for 4326 for view in google earth
    FIXME tilecache @ telascience does not work, note its picking up the global install

layers:
    need getancestors for the lay loading view!!!!

    save views

    bookmarks could be a seperate tree, it mnay be good to share these with other regestered users ans public


    change layer pkeys to bigint
    move choices inside the class
    only return tree items you have perms to view
    real forms for adding data
    the help text needs populated for everything
    add perms to the tree


    add a refresh option to the layers, both a list of times, and an interval
    add center and zoom for layers

mapfile:
    color picker
    editor to draw symbols
    real forms for adding data
    the array stuff works but the form is a text field
    allow nulls
    the help text needs populated for everything
    map/config should be a table or array or something
    map dont seem to have layer id
    many of the sub tables can have multiple there is only one now


map:

    add a print mechanism
    the help text needs populated for everything

    refresh the client when the layer tree changes, perhaps signals again in the map app
    do the admin so you can do intial settings

    pink tiles are bad!


[13:18:23] * HyperJohn has changed the topic to: http://maps.telascience.org/map/#&open=1,2&zoom=18&lon=-117.23456987478615&lat=32.88229130553326&layers=4
[13:18:27] <MartinSpott> s/Winderful/Wonderful/
[13:18:55] <HyperJohn> odd its zooming to the wrong place in the link
[13:19:40] <winkey> how far off?
[13:19:48] <MartinSpott> once it's loaded it isn't zooming back to the initial zoom level when loading again
[13:19:52] <HyperJohn> click on it
[13:20:00] <HyperJohn> whwhat do you see
[13:20:17] <winkey> i see a daM
[13:20:33] <HyperJohn> that lat lon is foe UCSD
[13:20:48] <HyperJohn> zoom back
[13:21:25] <HyperJohn> it never moved it just zoomed
[13:21:43] <HyperJohn> went to map default center
[13:21:50] <winkey> ok

tree.js

    tooltips

    perms

    when layers get turned on, center and zoom if set

    how do we update the tree when the data is updated?

    drag and drop

    autohide the tree with TogglePane + BC 

    radio folders should be checkable (not base layers)

    save temp layer data

    make links work

    
menues.js
    need rightclick menues in the layer tree to add delete etc..

time.js
    time slider should update the url hash, bookmarks should include the time
    make the view in google earth button do timestamps/timezones
    all the time settings should be in the url has as long as there is data in the list
    add center and zoom when a layer becomes "active"
    split timeslider
        the time slider toolbar should display the current datetime 
     do a node of each begm end, ts then loop and retest to the current time

[12:04:28] <HyperJohn> i was thinking a fade out timer on the close loop
[12:05:00] <winkey> close?
[12:05:20] <HyperJohn> the next step
[12:05:49] <winkey> i am not catching what youy mean
[12:05:54] <HyperJohn> dont turn off the last layer
[12:05:58] <HyperJohn> fade off
[12:06:04] <winkey> ohh on the loop?
[12:06:12] <HyperJohn> yup
[12:06:52] <HyperJohn> so call something that changes the layer transparency till its gone then remove
[12:08:11] <HyperJohn> then a fade in on the other end and you have smoothed animation




bookmark app:

    we could call them views, and 
    bookmarks are all the url hash vars stored in a seperate table


owslib app:
    [14:14:20] <winkey> https://pypi.python.org/pypi/OWSLib
    [14:14:53] <winkey> i think a add all layers on wms feature would be neat
    [14:15:11] <winkey>  Author: Tom Kralidis
    [14:16:16] <winkey> or a window that lists them as checkboxes
    [14:16:57] <winkey> mayby a thing that adds them as a siggle or as a seperate

    or something like the wms inspector for js on the client side?

vector app:
    some sort of vector data aplication
    upload data mech


raster app:
    raster data in db?



greyline app:
    this could just be a client side thing, its a circle

mapnik support?
